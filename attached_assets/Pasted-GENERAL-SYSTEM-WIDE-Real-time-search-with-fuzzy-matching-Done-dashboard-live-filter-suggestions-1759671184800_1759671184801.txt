WHAT I’LL TACKLE NEXT (fastest impact)
Staff
Add “Assign to Section” action on each student row (persists via enrollment API).
Wire “Save Attendance” to persist a daily record; show per‑day summary.
CSV export of all students from API (not just visible).
Dashboard
Replace remaining placeholder metrics with live aggregates (attendance summary_today, documents, evaluations, notifications for user).
Faculty
Minimal persistence for Gradebook save and Class Attendance; reflect to Student “My Grades” and dashboard stats.
Student
Pull course list and attendance from persisted enrollment/attendance; reflect tuition from Staff updates once wired.
